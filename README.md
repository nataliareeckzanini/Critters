Critters (adapted from UW CSE 142 final project, their CS210 equivalent)

Chapter 9: Programming Projects #2 (MODIFIED as per the  attachment). 

Read: Assignment2.pdf

Java code required as the GUI driver is also attached:  Critters.zip 

The attached files are directly from the text website authors, and do not meet my required standards for code commenting, i.e. no name and date in every header, but I'm trying hard to follow the text, and I won't agree with every detail they publish.  I'll cut them slack this time, as the package is good, I know it's really their work, and they did have to design something for thousands of users over years of courses.

DO NOT change anything in the Critters.zip java code, as it's what I'll use to test your programs:

Grading:

- Of course your work must compile and load into my Critters Frame.
- Behavior of each must be the patterns described in attached pdf.
- Coding must be well formatted as per specs in previous assignment (always applies).
- QA word document of test cases run with screen shots of output of your running program. It should show and have explanations of how your programs meets the requirements of the assignment.  Itâ€™s fine if your program cannot handle all the edge cases but you need to document what it can and cannot handle.
- 
Upload your completed Critter java code, as individual java attachments(only .java files) along with your QA word document(.doc files or .docx) with screen shots of output of your running program.
